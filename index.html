										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>I graduated from Ball State University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My 
											next move was to Reston, VA to attend Revature's training program. Revature then 
											contracted me to H&R Block in Kansas City, MO, where I've been working for just over 
											16 months.<br/>
											<br/>
											The majority of my development experience has been working with automating end-to-end 
											test cases, as well as some development with SCSS and Angular. Though most of my 
											experience has dealt with frontend technologies, I'm eager to learn any technology!

										<h2 class="major">Revature LLC</h2>
										<p>Training at Revature was one of the most challenging times of my life, but in the end it 
											was entirely worth every moment of strife. The class I was in (or "batch" as it was 
											officially called) handled a wide range of technologies, ranging from C#, ASP.NET and 
											Entity Framework to HTML, Angular, and CSS. We even went over Azure DevOps and Docker 
											just before my training was complete!
										</p>
										<p id="revature-extra-info" hidden=true>
											We worked on three different projects, each assigned over the course of three weeks; a 
											solo project, a group project, and an enterprise-level project. The first one, of course, 
											was one that each trainee completed alone, create a CLI app that involved ordering pizzas 
											with different toppings and other options. The second project was with a team of four devs, 
											which ours ended up suffering due to an imbalance in class numbers; we started with three 
											members, and then one member had to be dropped from the program for clerical reasons. The
											final project, which was a group project with everyone in the batch, was one where we made 
											an application for Revature to use in their housing department which sorted incoming 
											trainees into available apartments, while also ensuring that apartments that didn't have a 
											"driver" tenant would have priority to receive a new tenant with a vehicle.

										<h2 class="major">H&R Block</h2>
										<p>After my training at Revature was complete, I was contracted to a client called UST Global, 
											who then contracted me to H&R Block. In the beginning they knew that I needed to be brought 
											up to speed on how the application worked, so I was tasked with smoke testing the program. 
											Our team was called Silverlight Remediation (SLR), and we were tasked with coming up with 
											a way to make software like a previous version work, but without the use of Silverlight as 
											it was being discontinued.
										</p>
										<p id="hrb-extra-info" hidden=true>
											Truth be told, I wasn't involved much with designing the solution to our Silverlight problem; 
											After the first few months of smoke testing, I was tasked with automating the tests using 
											Protractor. It took me a while to get used to it since I was new to automated testing, needed 
											to learn how the Azure pipeline worked, and once I was finished and the SLR team was no longer 
											needed, my team was grafted into the Blockworks Online (BWO) team.<br/>
											<br/>
											My first task on the BWO 
											team was to refactor the old CSS code from our legacy software into SCSS. Occasionally I also 
											assisted one of my teammates with a tool he was developing to build the application, but the 
											lion's share of the tool's code was his creation. After another month of SCSS refactoring and 
											then a month of documenting how we use it, I was re-assigned to smoke testing.
